# AAI FASHION ASISTS (Semantic Spotter) - Myntra

## Description
Create a generative search system capable of searching a plethora of product descriptions to find and recommend appropriate choices against a user query. You may use this Myntra dataset on Kaggle to build such a system.

On modern e-commerce platforms like Myntra, users are often presented with an overwhelming number of product descriptions, making it difficult to efficiently locate relevant items. Typically, users have specific queries or requirements, such as seeking products with particular features, styles, or brands. The main challenge lies in creating a search system that can comprehend natural language queries, sift through extensive product descriptions, and deliver precise and relevant product recommendations.

## Goals
### Develop a Sophisticated Search System: Create a search engine that understands and accurately interprets natural language queries, delivering relevant and precise product recommendations.
### Ensure User Experience: Design a system that queries data while providing a fast, intuitive, and personalized search experience.

## Key Challenges:
### Natural Language Understanding: The system must accurately comprehend and interpret user queries expressed in natural language.
### Data Integration: The system needs to integrate various data sources and manage comprehensive product descriptions.
### Relevance and Accuracy: The system must produce search results that are both relevant to the userâ€™s query and precise.
### Scalability: The system should handle an increasing number of products and queries without a drop in performance.
### User Experience: Ensuring that the search interface is intuitive and user-friendly, facilitating an easy and efficient search process.
### Real-Time Processing: The system should provide fast and real-time search results, enhancing user satisfaction and engagement.
### Personalization: The system must incorporate user preferences and behavior to provide personalized search results and recommendations.
### Multilingual Support: The system should support multiple languages to cater to a diverse user base.
### Security and Privacy: Ensuring that user data is protected and privacy is maintained throughout the search process.
### daptability: The system must adapt to changing trends, new products, and user behavior over time to maintain its effectiveness.

Steps To Runt he Notebook

1. Import the notebook into Google Colab
2. Set the OpenAI API key appropriately
3. Download and place the necessaary files at appropriate location and modify the location int he notebook accordingly
4. Either select "Run All' or Run individual cells
5. The notebook will first start and except user's input for gradio interface for LangChain.
6. Once the gradio for LangChain is stopped manually, other cells below it can be executed to check out the results for LLamaIndex which too has a Gradio interface
